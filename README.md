# RazumAI.ch

**RazumAI** builds trustworthy Generative AI systems for regulated environments.

We focus on:
- GenAI-based validation of manufacturing recipe data in pharmaceutical production (GxP)
- Cross-model memory and context persistence for LLMs (BrainTransplant)

We operate a public benchmark to evaluate how well different Generative AI systems detect ALCOA+ violations in structured recipe records. The benchmark supports OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, and custom-trained models, and is designed to meet traceability and auditability expectations in regulated industries.

## Public Projects

### [`genai-recipe-audit-benchmark`](https://github.com/RazumAI-ch/genai-recipe-audit-benchmark)
An open-source benchmark for ALCOA+ deviation detection in pharmaceutical manufacturing records. Designed to validate the quality and compliance potential of GenAI systems in GxP environments.

### [`braintransplant-ai`](https://github.com/RazumAI-ch/braintransplant-ai)
*A GenAI chat app that mimics native interfaces like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini â€” but with persistent memory that travels across models.*

The name *BrainTransplant* reflects the key idea: you can swap out the brain (the LLM) but keep the memory intact. Conversations stay consistent even as you move between providers.

BrainTransplant is a cross-platform app that gives you full control over your AI memory. It stores your history across sessions and models, reinjects relevant context using RAG, and avoids vendor lock-in. You decide when history is recorded, and you can review or delete it at any time.

## Organization

**RazumAI** is operated by Razum GmbH, Switzerland.  
We are currently working with pharmaceutical companies and regulatory stakeholders to deploy GenAI validation tooling in production environments.
